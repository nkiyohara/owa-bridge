# CLI

The CLI exposes the supported typed application surface. Deterministic
contracts are fully tested; live Outlook Web observations are recorded
separately in [compatibility evidence](compatibility.md).

## Configure

Create the strict, secret-free default configuration:

```console
owa config init
owa config validate
owa config path
```

Use `--config /absolute/path/config.toml` before the command, or set
`OWA_CONFIG`, to select another file. Initialization refuses to replace an
existing path unless `--force` is explicit. A symlink, directory, or other
non-regular target is rejected even with `--force`.

Edit account origins and policy in the generated TOML. See
[configuration.md](configuration.md) for the schema.

## Diagnose and run the opt-in compatibility smoke test

Check the strict config, selected account, Chromium-family executable, and
config-scoped local IPC without opening a browser:

```console
owa doctor
owa doctor --json
```

After local checks pass, explicitly opt into live compatibility testing:

```console
owa doctor --online
```

The online form opens the normal interactive browser when needed, captures the
session only in daemon memory, and performs one bounded folder metadata read,
one inbox metadata read, and one one-hour calendar metadata read. The report
emits no folder, message, event, recipient, mailbox-count, authorization, or
response-body data. A failure is
non-zero and identifies the local, session, mail-contract, or calendar-contract
stage that failed.

See [compatibility evidence](compatibility.md) for the live-test checklist and
the data that is safe to include in a report.

## Authenticate

```console
owa login
owa login --account work --json
```

The command connects to the config-scoped session owner, starting it if needed.
The daemon opens a visible dedicated browser profile and waits for Outlook Web
to emit an authorized request. It never accepts credentials on the command
line. JSON output contains only account alias, status, and capture time; the
authorization snapshot remains in the daemon.

## Discover mail folders

```console
owa mail folders
owa mail folders --traversal shallow --parent inbox
owa mail folders --parent-id 'opaque-discovered-id' --json
```

Folder discovery is bounded to 100 entries per page and starts at the message
folder root by default. It returns display names, opaque IDs, parent IDs, folder
class, and aggregate item/unread/child counts. It does not request rules,
permissions, delegates, item content, or mailbox identities. Use an exact ID
with `mail list --folder-id` to address a custom folder without relying on its
mutable display name.

## List mail metadata

```console
owa mail list
owa mail list --folder archive --limit 50
owa mail list --folder-id 'opaque-discovered-id' --json
```

The human table sanitizes terminal control characters and includes the full,
copyable message ID. The JSON form returns the stable `MailPage` schema and
still excludes message bodies and attachment content.

## Search mail metadata

```console
owa mail search --query 'subject:"Quarterly plan" from:alice'
owa mail search --query 'kind:email attachment:report' --limit 50
owa mail search \
  --folder-id 'opaque-discovered-id' \
  --query 'body:proposal NOT from:bot' \
  --json
```

Search is scoped to one distinguished or discovered folder and returns the
same metadata-only `MailPage` as `mail list`. The query uses Outlook's
user-facing AQS subset, is limited to 1024 UTF-8 bytes, and each result page is
limited to 50 entries. It is treated as private input: audit records contain an
operation digest, not the query. There is no raw OWA action, arbitrary JSON, or
message-body field in this interface. AQS operators and property support are
defined by [Microsoft's QueryString reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/client-developer/web-service-reference/querystring-querystringtype).

Read plain text for one exact ID returned by the list command:

```console
owa mail body --message-id 'opaque-message-id'
owa mail body --message-id 'opaque-message-id' --json
```

The body is bounded to 1 MiB and requested as plain text. Human output strips
terminal control sequences; JSON output escapes them. If
`preview_sensitive_reads` is enabled, add `--approve` to prepare and consume the
exact read in the same CLI process. MCP keeps preview and commit as separate
calls instead.

## Move one message

Use the exact message ID and change key returned by `mail list` or `mail search`:

```console
owa mail move \
  --message-id 'opaque-message-id' \
  --change-key 'opaque-change-key' \
  --destination archive

owa mail move \
  --message-id 'opaque-message-id' \
  --change-key 'opaque-change-key' \
  --destination-id 'opaque-folder-id' \
  --json
```

The command moves exactly one versioned item to one destination discovered
under the selected account. A stale change key fails closed instead of silently
moving a newer version.
`preview_reversible_writes = true` makes the first call return an exact preview;
rerun with `--approve` to consume it in the same CLI process. MCP always keeps
preview and commit as separate tool calls when policy requests approval.

`MoveItem` is attempted once. If Outlook may have committed before a 429, 5xx,
or transport failure, the command reports an unknown outcome and never retries;
list both the source and destination before acting again. Outlook can omit the
new item ID, in which case list the destination to refresh it.

## Mark one message read or unread

```console
owa mail mark \
  --message-id 'opaque-message-id' \
  --change-key 'opaque-change-key' \
  --state read

owa mail mark \
  --message-id 'opaque-message-id' \
  --change-key 'opaque-change-key' \
  --state unread \
  --json
```

This is a closed single-property update: the only accepted states are `read`
and `unread`, and callers cannot provide an OWA field name or arbitrary update
JSON. The exact change key and `NeverOverwrite` conflict resolution make stale
updates fail closed. Read receipts are suppressed. Like move and draft, policy
can require `--approve`; like every write, the network request is attempted
once and an ambiguous result is never retried automatically.

## Create a save-only draft

```console
printf 'Hello from owa-bridge.\n' | \
  owa mail draft \
    --to alice@example.com \
    --cc bob@example.com \
    --subject 'Synthetic example' \
    --body-file -

owa mail draft \
  --to alice@example.com \
  --subject 'From a file' \
  --body-file ./body.txt \
  --json
```

Repeat `--to`, `--cc`, or `--bcc` for additional bare addresses. The command
accepts the body only from a file or stdin so message content does not appear in
the process argument list. Subject and body injection characters, oversized
content, and recipient counts above `max_recipients` are rejected before any
network request.

This operation uses OWA `CreateItem` with `SaveOnly`; it does not send mail.
The transport makes exactly one attempt to avoid duplicate drafts after an
ambiguous timeout. If `preview_reversible_writes` is enabled, add `--approve`
to review and commit the exact draft in the same CLI process. MCP exposes the
preview and commit as distinct tool calls.

## Review and send a new message

Preview only:

```console
printf 'Hello from owa-bridge.\n' | \
  owa mail send \
    --to alice@example.com \
    --subject 'Exact send preview' \
    --body-file -
```

After checking every recipient, subject, bounded body preview, body byte count,
and SHA-256 digest, repeat the exact command with `--approve`. The CLI prints
the normalized review to stderr immediately before committing and writes the
result to stdout. `--json` returns the same stable preview or result schema.

Sending is always an external-write `preview -> commit`; no configuration can
bypass it. The daemon binds the full immutable composition, account, caller,
expiry, and one-time token. It then calls `CreateItem` once with
`SendAndSaveCopy` and the Sent Items folder. It never retries. If the connection
fails after submission, the command reports an unknown outcome: inspect Sent
Items before creating another preview, because retrying could duplicate mail.

Only new plain-text messages are supported in this stage. Replies, forwards,
HTML, attachments, delayed delivery, and draft sending require separate typed
contracts and are not silently emulated.

Each invocation connects to the same session-owning daemon for its selected
config. The daemon lazily opens one dedicated browser per account, retains the
in-memory session, executes through `MailService`, and appends content-free audit
events. CLI processes never receive Outlook authorization material.

## Session owner

```console
owa daemon start
owa daemon status
owa daemon status --json
owa daemon stop
```

`start` launches one background process for the selected absolute config path
and state directory. Ordinary `login`, mail, calendar, and MCP commands start it
automatically when absent. `serve` runs the same process in the foreground for
service managers and diagnostics. No TCP port is opened: Linux and macOS use an
owner-only Unix socket with same-effective-user peer verification, while Windows
uses a local-only named pipe whose ACL grants the current user and SYSTEM.

Every start rotates an additional 256-bit bearer credential stored in a private
state file. Requests are strict, versioned, size-bounded JSON calls over the
local transport. `stop` is authenticated, drains active calls, and removes the
credential and socket. Stopping an idle daemon closes all account browsers;
later commands start a fresh owner and reuse the protected browser profiles.

## List calendar metadata

```console
owa calendar list \
  --start 2026-07-17T00:00:00Z \
  --end 2026-07-18T00:00:00Z
owa calendar list \
  --start 2026-07-17T00:00:00+01:00 \
  --end 2026-07-24T00:00:00+01:00 \
  --json
```

The interval is start-inclusive, end-exclusive, and limited to 31 days. The
transport converts absolute RFC3339 boundaries to UTC before calling
`GetCalendarView`. Results contain event metadata but exclude bodies, attendee
lists, attachments, and online-meeting join URLs. The human table includes the
full event ID and change key needed by later versioned update or cancellation
commands.

## Review and create a calendar event

Preview an appointment without attendees:

```console
printf 'Private planning notes.\n' | \
  owa calendar create \
    --subject 'Planning block' \
    --start 2026-07-20T09:00:00+01:00 \
    --end 2026-07-20T10:00:00+01:00 \
    --location 'Room Example' \
    --body-file -
```

Add `--required-attendee` or `--optional-attendee` repeatedly to prepare a
meeting. Add `--teams-meeting` to ask Outlook to provision a Microsoft Teams
join link. The first call always prints the exact calendar, subject, start, end,
location, attendee sets, whether invitations will be sent, whether a Teams link
will be created, bounded body preview, body byte count, and SHA-256 digest. It
creates nothing.

After reviewing every field, repeat the exact command with `--approve`. The CLI
prints the review to stderr immediately before committing. OWA's specialized
`CreateCalendarEvent` action is attempted exactly once with
`SendToAllAndSaveCopy` when attendees are present, or `SendToNone` for an
appointment. A Teams request uses only the closed `TeamsForBusiness` provider;
the successful commit result includes the join URL when Outlook provisions it.
If submission has an unknown outcome, inspect the calendar before preparing
another event; an automatic retry could create a duplicate or send duplicate
invitations.

This typed stage supports one plain-text, non-recurring, non-all-day event up to
31 days long. Recurrence, all-day semantics, HTML, reminders, attachments, and
arbitrary online-meeting providers are not silently approximated. The body is
read from a file or stdin and is bounded to 1 MiB. `--json` returns the same
stable preview/result schema used by MCP.

## Update one event version

Use the exact ID and change key from `calendar list`:

```console
owa calendar update \
  --event-id 'opaque-event-id' \
  --change-key 'opaque-change-key' \
  --subject 'Updated design review' \
  --start 2026-07-20T10:00:00+01:00 \
  --end 2026-07-20T11:00:00+01:00
```

The closed patch accepts subject, plain-text body, start plus end, and location.
Use `--clear-subject`, `--clear-body`, or `--clear-location` for an explicit
clear. `--body-file` reads replacement content from a file or stdin. Start and
end must be supplied together and remain a positive interval of at most 31
days. There is no arbitrary field URI or JSON update surface.

The first call always previews and changes nothing. Repeat the exact command
with `--approve` to submit the specialized `UpdateCalendarEvent` action once
with the listed ID/change key and default event scope. A stale key fails closed.
Outlook controls meeting-update notifications, so existing attendees may
receive an update; attendee membership itself is not changed in this stage.
List the calendar afterward when Outlook omits a refreshed change key.

## Cancel one event version

```console
owa calendar cancel \
  --event-id 'opaque-event-id' \
  --change-key 'opaque-change-key'
```

The first call is a destructive preview only. Repeat it with `--approve` to
call `DeleteItem` once, move that exact event version to Deleted Items, and ask
Outlook to send meeting cancellations to all attendees. A stale change key
fails closed. Recurrence-series editing is not exposed; select only an event ID
whose scope you understand from Outlook.

If update or cancellation has an unknown outcome, inspect the calendar and
Deleted Items before another action. Preparing and committing another preview
could duplicate notifications or target a newer version.

## MCP

```console
owa mcp serve
owa mcp setup codex
owa mcp setup codex --dry-run
owa mcp setup claude-code
owa mcp setup claude-code --scope project
owa mcp config codex
owa mcp config claude-code
```

`setup` invokes `codex mcp add` or `claude mcp add` without rewriting client
configuration itself. `config` prints native TOML or JSON for review and
advanced settings. See [MCP integration](mcp.md) for details.

## Generate shell completion

```console
owa completion bash
owa completion zsh
owa completion fish
```

The generated script invokes the installed `owa` from `PATH` only while the
shell requests candidates. Completion is derived from the live CLI command
model and performs no Outlook operation.

## Machine-readable behavior

Commands with `--json` write one JSON value to stdout. Interactive progress and
diagnostics go to stderr. Errors return a non-zero exit code and do not include
authorization values or OWA response bodies.
